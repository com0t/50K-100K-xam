= How does it work? =

The WooCommerce Product Import Export Plugin takes CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file as input. You must create a CSV ( UTF-8 Encoded ) file and enter the product details in a structured format as explained in the tutorial. This is to match each field of CSV file to the field of a particular product which otherwise admin need to input manually. For example: the post_title field gets mapped to the product name and the regular_price field gets mapped to the regular price of the product. For the plugin to work correctly, you must map headers of all of the columns correctly and you must ensure that all of the fields you enter is in the correct format.

You can create the CSV from scratch or you can export the product to get the format of CSV. You can use a spreadsheet program, such as LibreOffice , Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice or Google Spreadsheets for creating and modifying the CSV file. Save this file with extension .CSV. After entering all details about products in spreadsheet, you can import product to your online store. With this plugin, you can also export and download product details as a CSV file.
